I got my B.S. in History from Texas Woman's University, with a minor in Multicultural Women's and Gender Studies. I'm currently in Northeastern's Public History master's program. I completed my senior capstone on early American women's travel narratives.

### More Casual Info

I have two cats, Georgie and Olsen, who are the lights of my life. I enjoy crafting, specifically crocheting and cross stitch. I don't *love* painting, but that's mostly because I'm bad at it. I'm currently watching  Call The Midwife, and I'm enjoying it very much. It's **so** good! I also enjoy reading.
