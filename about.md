# An Overview

I got my B.S. in History from Texas Woman's University, with a minor in Multicultural Women's and Gender Studies. I'm currently in Northeastern's Public History master's program. I completed my senior capstone on early American women's travel narratives.

## More Casual Info

I have two cats, Georgie and Olsen, who are the lights of my life. I enjoy crafting, specifically crocheting and cross stitch. I don't *love* painting, but that's mostly because I'm bad at it. I'm currently watching  Call The Midwife, and I'm enjoying it very much. It's **so** good! I also enjoy reading.

## My Current DH Project

The Core Principles:
* Uses topic modeling to examine the values reflected in early American women's travel narratives. 
* Examines both pre-revolution and post-revolution to see if the American Revolution had an effect on women's values.
* Utilizing a variety of travel narratives that have differences in women's class, location, religion, etc.
